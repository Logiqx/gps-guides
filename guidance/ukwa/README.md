## UKWA Thoughts - WIP

### Introduction

Many people will think that GPS is almost a magical technology that is highly accurate and that all modern devices are good enough for competition.

The reality is far more complicated and allowing the use of unapproved devices needs to be done so with caution. Everyone wants to compete on a level playing field.



### Mitigations

#### Doppler Speed

Doppler-derived speeds are far more accurate and reliable than speeds derived from positional data. Doppler-derived speeds are also far less prone to massive spikes.

Doppler speeds should always be posted to GP3S by downloading the FIT from Garmin Connect or the Suunto App.

GPX files should **not** be used because they do not contain the Doppler speeds.



#### Crashes

Spikes and erroneous readings occur most often during a crash or entering the water.

For this reason, any run that ends in a crash will be excluded.



#### Slingshots

It has been observed that significant over-reading can occur on devices such as the Garmin Fenix 3 during slingshots. The GPS overestimates the speed during the acceleration phase and the deceleration phase.

For this reason, any run which includes a slingshot will be excluded.
