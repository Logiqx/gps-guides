## Known Issues

### Firmware

Firmware issues in 2024 have already discussed, but just as a reminder:

- APEX Pro + VERTIX
  - 3.0309.0 and 3.0409.0 were good versions, so keep them installed.
  - DO NOT upgrade to 3.0508.0
- APEX 2 + APEX 2 Pro + VERTIX 2 / 2S
  - 3.0308.0 was the last good version, so keep it installed.
  - DO NOT upgrade to 3.0408.0, 3.0409.0, 3.0508.0 or 3.0510.0



### Watch Display

There are a number of niggly display bugs that you may notice during a session:

- New record alerts sometimes say the wrong thing, like "2s" instead of "5 x 10s".
- Run detection does not understand turns (gybe or tack), so you can sail for hours and only do one run!
- The algorithm that calculates alphas on the watch does not work correctly, quite different to GP3S.



### Data Exports

There are some known recording issues:

- Newer watches such as the VERTIX 2 can record the GNSS data in a way that leads to [fantasy alphas](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-details/devices/coros/alpha/) on GP3S.
