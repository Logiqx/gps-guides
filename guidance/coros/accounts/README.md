## Linked Accounts

It is a good idea to link your COROS account to other websites, such as GPS-Speedsurfing and Hoolan or Waterspeed.

This will ensure that your sessions are automatically uploaded to these websites, without doing manual data exports and data imports.

Some of the more popular choices are described in the following sections.



### GPS-Speedsurfing

You can link your COROS account to [GPS-Speedsurfing](https://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/) (GP3S) using the "[My Devices](https://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/mygps.aspx?mnu=mydevices)" page.

Dashboard -> My Items -> My Devices

Select the COROS option under (re-)Connect a device which will then walk you through the process, probably requiring your registered COROS username and password.

Once the connection process has been completed your speedsurfing sessions will automatically be uploaded to GP3S, allowing you to quickly post to any of the GP3S sites.

What actually happens is the FIT files for your sessions are processed by GP3S, whereby obvious spikes are removed. Some spikes (especially Sony ones) can slip through the filters.



### Hoolan + Waterspeed

Hoolan and Waterspeed are popular apps with Apple watch users. Hoolan and Waterspeed can both be linked to your Garmin Connect account, ensuring that watersport activities are automatically uploaded to their platforms.

This capability doesn't exist for COROS watches right now, but might become available in the future. I'm not privy to any information saying that this will ever happen, just saying that it is theoretically possible!



### Strava + Relive

You can link your COROS account to Strava and Relive, but I feel obliged to provide a warning. Strava does NOT know how to process the speed data recorded by your COROS watch (or any watch tbh) and can lead to fictitious speeds.

If you want to get techie, Strava does not process the Doppler-derived speeds from the GPS / GNSS chipset and therefore prone to spikes. These spikes may be small (e.g. just a few knots), or large (e.g. tens of knots).

Strava is fine as an activity diary, recording where you sailed and how far, but you should completely disregard any of the max speeds being reported. No, you can't just eyeball the data and remove obvious spikes yourself...
