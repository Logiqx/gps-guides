## COROS Advice

Do you own a COROS watch, or thinking of buying one for windsurfing / wingfoiling / kitesurfing? If your answer is yes, then this guide has been written specifically for you and your mates!

All GPS receivers are prone to errors, but some are more susceptible than others. Even if you own the best GPS watch, your settings and how you use it will influence the accuracy and likelihood of speeds being legitimate.

This guide has been written to help you get the best accuracy and features out of your COROS watch(es), and hopefully get as much enjoyment from your sessions as possible. ðŸ¤™



### Topics

There is quite a lot to cover, but I'll try to be concise and will cover the following topics:

- [Watch choice](choice/README.md)
  - GNSS chipset and general features
- [Watch setup](setup/README.md)
  - Firmware and watch settings
- [Linking accounts](accounts/README.md)
  - GPS-Speedsurfing, Hoolan, Waterspeed, Strava, Relive
- [Watch usage](usage/README.md)
  - Wearing the watch, recording an activity, additional tips
- [Data analysis](analysis/README.md)
  - Reviewing results, exporting activities, importing activities
- [Known issues](issues/README.md)

Please let me know if you find the guide useful, or whether anything needs further clarification.



### Summary

I appreciate this was quite a long article, so here is a quick summary!

1. Choose a watch that uses the Airoha chipset - APEX 2, APEX 2 Pro, VERTIX 2 or VERTIX 2S.
2. Set it up properly - firmware and settings, especially the satellite systems which should be "all systems".
3. Link your COROS account to GPS-Speedsurfing, Hoolan, Waterspeed, etc.
4. Ensure your watch has a clear view of the sky for as much of the time as possible (especially during speed runs) and use the speedsurfing activity (different to windsurfing).
5. Try out the applications GpsarPro, GPSResults, and GPS Speedreader for more insights into your tracks.

A couple of notes about the most common causes of data issues, elevated speeds, and spikes:

- Exporting GPX files and importing them into GPS-Speedsurfing, Waterspeed, Strava, etc.
- COROS watches using the Sony chipset are especially prone to spikes - APEX Pro, VERTIX.
- COROS watches that do not provide a speedsurfing mode are prone to spikes - APEX, PACE 2, PACE 3, etc.
- Firmware issues since May 2024 have made the better watches suffer from these same issues!
- Newer watches such as the VERTIX 2 are prone to spikes when using standard GPS and windsurfing mode.



I hope this guide is useful to people who own a COROS watch. The advice will help you to get the most from your watch and maximize the chances of your speeds being accurate.
