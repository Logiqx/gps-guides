## COROS Advice

Do you own a COROS watch, or planning to buy one for windsurfing / wingfoiling / kitesurfing? If your answer is yes, then this guide has been written specifically for you and your mates!

Knowing your speed on the water and whether you are faster than your mates adds an element of fun to your water time, but your watch choice and setup makes a big difference to the accuracy.

The problem with max speeds (popular at all levels) is their susceptibility to errors; small and large! During a routine test session my APEX Pro reported a max of [37.88](https://www.facebook.com/michael.george.545/posts/10220672656646659) knots when I was wingfoiling, instead of the actual 23 knots.

All GPS receivers are prone to errors, but some are more prone to issues than others. Even if you own a decent GPS watch, your setup and usage will have a huge impact on the likelihood of speeds being accurate / real.

This guide has been written to help you get the best out of your watch(es), and avoid the various pitfalls that await you and your mates at every stage!



### Topics

There is quite a lot to cover, but I'll try to be concise and will cover the following topics:

- [Watch choice](choice/README.md)
  - GNSS chipset and general features
- [Watch setup](setup/README.md)
  - Firmware and watch settings
- [Linked accounts](accounts/README.md)
  - GPS-Speedsurfing, Hoolan, Waterspeed, Strava, Relive
- [Watch usage](usage/README.md)
  - Wearing the watch, recording an activity, additional tips
- [Data analysis](analysis/README.md)
  - Reviewing results, exporting activities, importing activities
- [Known issues](issues/README.md)

Please let me know if you find the guide useful, or whether anything needs further clarification.



### Summary

I appreciate this was quite a long article, so here is a quick summary!

1. Choose a watch that uses the Airoha chipset - APEX 2, APEX 2 Pro, VERTIX 2 or VERTIX 2S.
2. Set it up properly - firmware and settings, especially the satellite systems which should be "all systems".
3. Link your COROS account to GPS-Speedsurfing, Hoolan, Waterspeed, etc.
4. Wear your watch on your back hand (when speed sailing) and always use the speedsurfing mode, not windsurfing.
5. Try out the applications GpsarPro, GPSResults, and GPS Speedreader to study and verify your tracks.
6. Aware of the known issues will help you to recognise when things are not quite right.

A couple of notes about the most common causes of data issues, elevated speeds, and spikes:

- Exporting GPX files and importing them into GPS-Speedsurfing, Waterspeed, Strava, etc.
- COROS watches using the Sony chipset are prone to spikes - APEX Pro, VERTIX
- COROS watches that do not provide a speedsurfing mode are prone to spikes - APEX, PACE 2, PACE 3, etc.
- Firmware issues since May 2024 have made the better watches suffer from these same issues!
- Newer watches such as the VERTIX 2 are prone to spikes when using standard GPS and windsurfing mode.



I hope this guide is useful to people who own a COROS watch. The advice will help you to get the most from your watch and maximise the chances of your speeds being accurate.
