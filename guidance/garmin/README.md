## Garmin Advice

Do you own a Garmin watch, or thinking of buying one for windsurfing / wingfoiling / kitesurfing? If your answer is yes, then this guide has been written specifically for you and your mates!

All GPS receivers are prone to errors, but some are more susceptible than others. Even if you own the best GPS watch, your settings and how you use it will influence the accuracy and likelihood of speeds being legitimate.

The biggest downside with comparing max speeds is the susceptibility to errors. For example, during a routine test session my APEX Pro recently reported a max of [37.88](https://www.facebook.com/michael.george.545/posts/10220672656646659) knots when I was wingfoiling, instead of the actual 23 knots!

This guide has been written to help you get the best accuracy and features out of your Garmin watch(es), and hopefully get as much enjoyment from your sessions as possible. ðŸ¤™
