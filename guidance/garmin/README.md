## Garmin Advice

Do you own a Garmin watch, or planning to buy one for windsurfing / wingfoiling / kitesurfing? If your answer is yes, then this guide has been written specifically for you and your mates!

Knowing your speed on the water and whether you are faster than your mates adds an element of fun to your water time, but your watch choice and setup can make a big difference to the accuracy.

The biggest problem with comparing max speeds is their susceptibility to errors; large and small. For example, during a routine test session my APEX Pro recently reported a max of [37.88](https://www.facebook.com/michael.george.545/posts/10220672656646659) knots when I was wingfoiling, instead of the actual 23 knots.

All GPS receivers are prone to errors, but some are more prone to issues than others. Even if you own a decent GPS watch, your setup and usage will have a huge influence on the likelihood of speeds being accurate / real.

This guide has been written to help you get the best out of your watch(es), and avoid the various pitfalls.
