## Watch Choice

Not as simple as Garmin, or Fenix.

Until earlier this year, I'd have advised against a Garmin

Last couple of years, good watches started to appear



### GNSS Chipset

Create coloured timeline?

- GNSS chipset is a primary factor
  - pre-2012 = SiRF
  - 2012 to 2018 = MediaTek
  - 2019 to 2021 = Sony (and Jan-Feb 2022 for the Instinct 2 and Venu 2 Plus)
    - Repeated speeds
    - Spikes after loss of lock
  - 2022 onwards = Airoha (except Jan-Feb 2022 for the Instinct 2 and Venu 2 Plus
    - Decent data when using the right firmware, settings, activity / application
    - Can be pretty terrible data if you get these things wrong!

### General Features

Activity profiles / applications

- Windsurfing activity - not available on Forerunner
- APPro Windsurf, GPSTC V4
- I've reviewed every other application

Things to consider:

- Satellite systems (Multi-Band, All Systems, GPS + Galileo / GPS + GLONASS)
- AMOLED display
- HR monitor
- Buttons or touchscreen (e.g. vívoactive / Venu) - relevant in water!
- Battery life

Mileage might vary... excuse the pun!

Airoha
fēnix 8, fēnix E, fēnix 7, epix (Gen 2), quatix 7, tactix 7 ... Instinct 2X (no apps)
Forerunner 165/255/265/955/965, Enduro 3, Enduro 2, vívoactive 5, Venu Sq 2, Venu 3
n.b. 165/265 and Venu 3 not supported by APPro Windsurf. Venu Sq. 2 not by Windsurfing App

Sony
fēnix 6, quatix 6, tactix Delta ... Instinct Solar, Instinct Esports, Instinct 2
Forerunner 45/55/158/245/745/945, Enduro, vívoactive 4, Venu, Venu Sq, Venu 2, Venu 2 Plus
IGNORE the Sony models!

MediaTek
fēnix [2/3/Chronos/5], epix, quatix [3/5], tactix [Bravo/Charlie] ... Instinct
Forerunner 10/15/25/30/35/220/225/230/235/620/630/645/735XT/920XT/935, vívoactive HR, vívoactive 3
n.b. fēnix® Chronos is too posh. Unsure if vívoactive HR is supported by the apps but no Galileo

Recommended watches from 2015 onwards, due to MT3333 and app support:
  fēnix® 3, fēnix® 5, quatix® 3, quatix® 5, tactix® Bravo, tactix® Charlie
  Forerunner [645/935], vívoactive® 3 - Galileo + both apps
