## Choosing a Device

In the last few years the quality of consumer GPS devices has improved a lot. For that reason [GP3S](https://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/default.aspx?mnu=item&item=GPSInfo) decided to accept non-verified devices for the so called "fun rankings" and day-to-day use. GP3S have concluded that many standard consumer devices are quite suitable for normal day-to-day usage and for the average session they can be a convenient alternative for many windsurfers. 

The concept of "verified" devices was introduced by GP3S back in 2009, primarily for the purpose of officially recognised [records](https://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/default.aspx?mnu=forum&forum=193) following very specific [rules](https://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/media/uploadimages/GPS_record_Rules%20VA1%202009-09-01.pdf), including the requirement for two approved GPS units. Records attempts must be pre-announced in the GP3S forum, require witnesses + additional evidence and individual ratification by the World GPS Surfing Record Committee.  

To encourage wider participation in GPS speedsurfing events it can make sense to allow modern consumer GPS devices from the likes of COROS, Garmin and Suunto; either for the "fun rankings" or some of the "events" hosted on GP3S. However, it is important that the tracks are properly exported (e.g. .FIT rather than .GPX) and analysed, rather than relying upon speeds displayed on the watch itself.

The following should be considered the minimum device requirements when posting to GP3S and any of the events:

- **1 Hz** logging is a minimum requirement. "Smart" logging is often the default setting and is not sufficient for speed sailing.
- **Doppler**-derived speed should be logged at a minimum of 1 Hz. This will typically necessitate .FIT exports instead of .GPX exports.
- On request, original tracks should be provided to the event organisers. Non-ratified sessions may be removed from the rankings.

A list of recommended devices can be found on [GP3S](https://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/default.aspx?mnu=item&item=GPSInfo) and more detailed information is also available on this [site](../devices/README.md). Ideally, anyone who cares about their speeds should simply use a dedicated device from the list on this [site](../devices/README.md).

Anyone using a sports watch (e.g. COROS, Garmin, Suunto, Timex) should always use .FIT exports for the reasons described in the articles relating to [Doppler-derived speed](doppler-speed.md) and [FIT vs GPX](fit-vs-gpx.md).

Mobile phones are generally not recommended for any kind of speed sailing because the quality / reliability of the GPS data can be hugely variable. It's also a bit risky taking your precious phone out on the water!
