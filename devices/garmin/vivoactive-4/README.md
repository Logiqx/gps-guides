The Vivoactive 4 was first released in 2019.

The Fenix 4 (left) is the standard model and Fenix 4S (right) is the smaller model.

Details about the [Vivoactive 4](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/643382) can be found on the Garmin website, plus the [manual](https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/vivoactive4_4S/EN-US/GUID-5F584975-CE56-49BF-A039-0E63B3ECF990-homepage.html).



### Tips

- Please read the general [guidance](../../../guidance.md) for all users of smart / sports watches.
- Change the data recording interval to "every second". The default is "smart" and is unsuitable for speed sailing.
- Export the session in the .FIT format in the Garmin Connect app. Do this using the "[original](https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=W1TvTPW8JZ6LfJSfK512Q8)" format.
- Try installing the [GPSTC data fields](https://www.haigh.id.au/GPSTC.htm) by TBWonder to monitor your best 2s, 10s, 5 x 10s, 1852m, alpha 500m and hour.
