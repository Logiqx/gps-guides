The Fenix 3 and Fenix 3 HR were released in 2015 / 2016 respectively.

Details about the [Fenix 3 / HR](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/160512) can still be found on the Garmin website, plus the [manual](https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/fenix3/EN-US/GUID-62011D9B-67F0-48B6-8A06-B0C0E6276F7E-homepage.html).



### Tips

- Please read the general [guidance](../../../guidance.md) for all users of smart / sports watches.
- Change the data recording interval to "every second". The default is "smart" and is unsuitable for speed sailing.
- Export the session in the .FIT format in the Garmin Connect app. Do this using the "[original](https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=W1TvTPW8JZ6LfJSfK512Q8)" format.
- Try installing the [GPSTC data fields](https://www.haigh.id.au/GPSTC.htm) by TBWonder to monitor your best 2s, 10s, 5 x 10s, 1852m, alpha 500m and hour.
