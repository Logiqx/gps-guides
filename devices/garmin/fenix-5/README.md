## Garmin Fenix 5S / 5 / 5X

![img](img/Garmin-Fenix5-5S-5X.jpg)



The Fenix 5 range was released in 2017. The 5S (left) is the smaller model and 5X (right) is the larger model.

There is a Sapphire edition and regular edition of the Fenix 5 + 5S, but only Sapphire edition of the Fenix 5X.

Aside from the non-scratch glass (in theory) the main difference is the Sapphire models have WiFi, whilst the regular models do not.

Details about the [Fenix 5S](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/552237) + [Fenix 5](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/552982) + [Fenix 5X](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/560327) can still be found on the Garmin website, plus the [manual](https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/fenix5/EN-US/GUID-C8E25FD1-3499-4B5C-B45F-C4BF88283284-homepage.html).



### Tips

- Please read the general [guidance](../../../guidance.md) for all users of smart / sports watches.
- Change the data recording interval to "every second". The default is "smart" and is unsuitable for speed sailing.
- Export the session in the .FIT format in the Garmin Connect app. Do this using the "[original](https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=W1TvTPW8JZ6LfJSfK512Q8)" format.
- Try installing the [GPSTC data fields](https://www.haigh.id.au/GPSTC.htm) by TBWonder to monitor your best 2s, 10s, 5 x 10s, 1852m, alpha 500m and hour.
