### Tips

- Please read the general [guidance](../../../guidance.md) for all users of smart / sports watches.
- Change the data recording interval to "every second". The default is "smart" and is unsuitable for speed sailing.
- Export the session in the .FIT format in the Garmin Connect app. Do this using the "[original](https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=W1TvTPW8JZ6LfJSfK512Q8)" format.
- Try installing the [GPSTC data fields](https://www.haigh.id.au/GPSTC.htm) by TBWonder to monitor your best 2s, 10s, 5 x 10s, 1852m, alpha 500m and hour.
