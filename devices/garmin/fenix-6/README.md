The Fenix 6 range was released in 2019. The 6X (left) is the larger model and 6S (right) is the smaller model.

There is a Sapphire, Pro and Solar edition for each of the 3 sizes, making 9 watches in total. The only differences are the Sapphire glass vs Gorilla glass (Pro) vs Power glass (Solar) and protective coatings on the metal parts.

Details about the [Fenix 6S](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/641501) + [Fenix 6](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/641449) + [Fenix 6X](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/641435) can be found on the Garmin website, plus the [manual](https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/fenix66s6xpro/EN-US/GUID-9C813064-813F-45E8-9F8E-98A2485B1BB1-homepage.html).



### Tips

- Please read the general [guidance](../../../guidance.md) for all users of smart / sports watches.
- Change the data recording interval to "every second". The default is "smart" and is unsuitable for speed sailing.
- Export the session in the .FIT format in the Garmin Connect app. Do this using the "[original](https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=W1TvTPW8JZ6LfJSfK512Q8)" format.
- Try installing the [GPSTC data fields](https://www.haigh.id.au/GPSTC.htm) by TBWonder to monitor your best 2s, 10s, 5 x 10s, 1852m, alpha 500m and hour.
