## Locosys GW-52

![apex-pro](img/gw-52-black.jpg)



Details about the [GW-52](https://www.locosystech.com/en/product/gps-handheld-data-logger-gw-52.html) can still be found on the Locosys website.

You can also find details about the device in my [first impressions](first-impressions.md), written in Nov 2015.

The GW-52 superseded the [GT-31](../gt-31/README.md) in 2015, when Locosys stopped producing the earlier model.

### Notes

- [SDOP](https://nujournal.net/estimating-accuracy-of-gps-doppler-speed-measurement-using-speed-dilution-of-precision-sdop-parameter/) on the GW-52 is typically lower than on the [GW-60](../gw-60/README.md) watch, possibly due to a larger antenna and better shielding.
