## Locosys GW-60

![apex-pro](img/gw-60.jpg)



Details about the [GW-60](https://www.locosystech.com/en/product/GPS-Doppler-Watch-GW-60/gps-watch-gw-60.html) can still be found on the Locosys website.

In many ways it is comparable to the [GW-52](../gw-52/README.md) but it has the added convenience of being a wrist watch. It also has slightly better functionality for reviewing speed results during and after the session.

Convenient as it was to have a wrist watch, the GW-60 was prone to water ingress and operating it via the buttons during a session ultimately lead to its demise!

### Observations

- [SDOP](https://nujournal.net/estimating-accuracy-of-gps-doppler-speed-measurement-using-speed-dilution-of-precision-sdop-parameter/) on the GW-60 is typically higher than on the [GW-52](../gw-52/README.md), possibly due to the smaller antenna and poorer shielding.
- Beware the effect of underhand grip as it increases error levels; higher SDOP.
  - Detail about this can be found in a test [session](../../../sessions/20220327/README.md) on 27 Mar 2022.
- You would be well advised not to press any buttons during a session!
  - Water ingress will eventually destroy the GW-60.
