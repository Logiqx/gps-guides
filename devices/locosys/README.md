## Locosys

Locosys was the benchmark for many years but they no longer make these devices.

- [GT-11](gt-11/README.md) - originally the benchmark for quality 1 Hz logging at an affordable price!
- [GT-31](gt-31/README.md) - still 1 Hz logging but with more accuracy and the addition of [SDOP](https://nujournal.net/estimating-accuracy-of-gps-doppler-speed-measurement-using-speed-dilution-of-precision-sdop-parameter/)
- [GW-52](gw-52/README.md) - smaller unit with 1 Hz and 5 Hz logging
- [GW-60](gw-60/README.md) - wristwatch with 1 Hz and 5 Hz logging
