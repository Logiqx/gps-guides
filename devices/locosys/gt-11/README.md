## Locosys GT-11

Details about the GT-11 can no longer be found on the Locosys website.

You can find some details about it in my [feature comparison](../../feature-comparison.pdf), last updated in Jul 2010.

This device was the original benchmark for quality 1 Hz logging at an affordable price!

In addition to the positional data (latitude and longitude) it recorded Doppler speed, COG, HDOP and satellite counts.
