## Locosys GT-31

![apex-pro](img/gt-31.jpg)



Details about the [GT-31](https://www.locosystech.com/en/product/gps-handheld-data-logger-gt-31.html) can still be found on the Locosys website.

This was a significant improvement to the [GT-11](../gt-11/README.md), thanks to use of a newer GPS chipset from SiRF:

- Faster satellite acquisition; time to first fix (TTFF).
- Increased positional accuracy.
- Less prone to spikes in Doppler speed data.
- Longer battery life.

[SDOP](https://nujournal.net/estimating-accuracy-of-gps-doppler-speed-measurement-using-speed-dilution-of-precision-sdop-parameter/) became available for the first time, allowing the Doppler speed accuracy to be estimated with 99% certainty.

The GT-31 was superseded by the [GW-52](../gw-52/README.md) in 2015, when Locosys stopped producing the GT-31.



### Tips

- Enable DGPS (SBAS) for improved positional accuracy.
