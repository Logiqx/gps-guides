## COROS

COROS became prominent on [GP3S](https://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/default.aspx?mnu=item&item=coros) during 2021.

- [APEX Pro](apex-pro/README.md) - The most "affordable" COROS option approved by GP3S.
- [VERTIX](vertix/README.md) - More rugged than the APEX Pro with 50% longer battery, should it be needed.
- [VERTIX 2](vertix-2/README.md) - The latest version of the VERTIX with a new GPS chipset.
