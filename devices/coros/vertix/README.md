![vertix](img/vertix.png)



Details about the [VERTIX](https://coros.com/vertix) can be found on the COROS website.

GPS-Speedsurfing.com (GP3S) and COROS worked together to develop a tailor made workout mode. This includes additional data for session verification and automatic uploading to GP3S. Further details can be found on the GP3S [website](https://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/default.aspx?mnu=item&item=coros).

The VERTIX is basically a more rugged version of the [APEX Pro](../apex-pro/README.md) with 50% more battery life and a higher waterproof rating; 150m vs 100m.

### Data Issues

Since the VERTIX shares the same Sony GPS chip and [firmware](https://mobile.coros.com/release) as the [APEX Pro](../apex-pro/README.md), I fully expect the VERTIX to have the same data issues.

I have written a separate article, summarising the observable [data issues](../apex-pro/data-issues.md) on the APEX Pro with links to further details and analysis. The data issues can be summarised as follows:

- Repeated speeds are not uncommon in the data (e.g. exactly the same speed for 5 or 6 seconds) and I've even seen speeds repeated for as long as 12 or 13 seconds.
- The resolution of Doppler speed data is only to within 5cm/s. This is 5 times lower than devices from Locosys and 50 times lower than devices such as the Motion.



### Tips

Since the APEX Pro, VERTEX and VERTEX 2 are so similar in features. all of the [tips](../tips.md) are identical.
