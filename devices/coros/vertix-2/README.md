Details about the [VERTIX 2](https://coros.com/vertix2) can be found on the COROS website.

GPS-Speedsurfing.com (GP3S) and COROS worked together to develop a tailor made workout mode. This includes additional data for session verification and automatic uploading to GP3S. Further details can be found on the GP3S [website](https://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/default.aspx?mnu=item&item=coros).

The VERTIX 2 is essentially an upgraded [VERTIX](../vertix/README.md) with improved battery life and a different GPS chip; replacing the Sony with the AG3335M from Airoha. The quality of the GPS data recorded by the VERTIX 2 is better than it's VERTIX predecessor and the APEX Pro.

The watch also sports dual-frequency (multi-band) GNSS which is claimed to increase accuracy.
