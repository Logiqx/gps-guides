![vertix-2](img/vertix-2.jpg)



Details about the [VERTIX 2](https://coros.com/vertix2) can be found on the COROS website.

GPS-Speedsurfing.com (GP3S) and COROS worked together to develop a tailor made workout mode. This includes additional data for session verification and automatic uploading to GP3S. Further details can be found on the GP3S [website](https://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/default.aspx?mnu=item&item=coros).

The VERTIX 2 is basically an upgraded [VERTIX](../vertix/README.md) with improved battery life and a different GPS chip; replacing the Sony with one from Airoha.

### Data Quality

The VERTIX 2 has a different GPS chipset to the VERTIX and APEX Pro, so I cannot comment on the likely data quality at this time.



### Tips

Since the APEX Pro, VERTIX and VERTIX 2 are so similar in features. all of the [tips](../tips.md) are identical.
