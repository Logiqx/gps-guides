## COROS Tips

### APEX Pro / VERTIX / VERTIX 2

Since all 3 devices are very similar in features the tips are identical:

- Set up the device correctly prior to speed sailing. 
  - I thoroughly recommend using the [guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YQbuPNeTJ3ivgykGI4qOz2yzMxxHmD9B/view?usp%3Dsharing) by [Ingolf van Oostveen](https://surf-center.com/nl/ingolf).
  - Use the [auto-sync](https://www.gps-speedsurfing.com/default.aspx?mnu=item&item=HowAddSession) feature on GP3S so that sessions can be posted quickly and easily.
- When exporting tracks for analysis, always choose the [FIT](https://developer.garmin.com/fit/protocol/) file format over [GPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format).
  - FIT files from sports watches tend to include Doppler speed in addition to latitude and longitude. FIT files also include metrics such as heart rate, temperature, etc.
  - COROS have also added some useful GPS information to the FIT data, enabling run verification for GP3S; Satellites, COG, HDOP.
  - GPX files contain latitude and longitude but not Doppler speed. Speeds calculated from positional data are less accurate than Doppler speeds and prone to "spikes".
- Avoid using GPS modes including GLONASS.
  - "GPS, Beidou, Galileo, QZSS" works well for most of Europe, including the UK.
- The feature to start / stop recording on your GoPro (or similar) could be really handy.
- Learn how to mark your current position, just in case of unfortunate incidents...
  - For example, if you lose your foil or GoPro, quickly mark your position!
  - Whilst in windsurf mode, hold down the back/lap button and select "save location".
- It is worth noting that tracks appear to be stored on the COROS servers, not within the COROS app on your phone.
  - During a remote walk with no mobile reception, I couldn't see any of my past APEX Pro sessions on my phone.
