The Motion LCD provides superior data quality compared to the popular [Locosys](../../locosys/README.md) devices and modern smart / sports watches from the likes of COROS, Garmin, Suunto and Polar.

The [UBX-M8030](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/ubx-m8030-series) GPS chip combined with Motion's custom filters, amplifier and oscillator provide high accuracy positional, speed and verification data at 10 Hz.

Unlike the Motion Mini this device has a screen for on-the-water feedback.
