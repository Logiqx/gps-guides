![img](img/gyro1.jpg)



The Gyro1 provides superior data quality compared to the popular [Locosys](../locosys/README.md) devices and modern smart / sports watches from the likes of COROS, Garmin, Suunto and Polar.

The u-blox [NEO-M8N](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neo-m8-series) GNSS module is based on the u-blox [UBX-M8030-KT](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/ubx-m8030-series) and provides high accuracy positional, speed and verification data up to 10 Hz or 18 Hz, depending on the GPS systems being used.

This was the first GPS device utilising a u-blox 8 chipset to be officially [approved](https://www.gps-icesailing.com/default.aspx?mnu=forum&forum=6&val=108406) by GP3S. The history of the device and how it was developed can be found on [Windsurfing.nl](https://forum.windsurfing.nl/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=13890429).

Further details for the [Gyro1](https://gearloose.nl/) can be found on the Gearloose.nl website, including a page to generate [configuration](https://gearloose.nl/gps.html) files.
