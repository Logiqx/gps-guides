## GPS Guides

### Background

Back in 2010, I published a GPS [feature comparison](guidance/features/feature-comparison.pdf) which focused on speed sailing and GPS devices of that time.

Things have moved on significantly in recent years, so this repository contains some more up-to-date information.
