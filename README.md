## GPS Guides

### Background

Back in 2010, I published an extensive GPS [feature comparison](devices/feature-comparison.pdf) with a primary focus on speed sailing.

The Locosys [GT-31](devices/locosys/gt-31/README.md) was the "gold-standard" device at the time but technology has since moved on and aside from writing up my first impressions of the Locosys [GW-52](devices/locosys/gw-52/README.md), I haven't written any subsequent GPS articles.

After several years using the Locosys [GW-60](devices/locosys/gw-60/README.md) watch (successor to the GW-52), I've now upgraded to the COROS [APEX Pro](devices/coros/apex-pro/README.md) and [Motion Mini](devices/motion/mini/README.md). I've been using the APEX Pro regularly since June 2021 and had the Motion Mini since mid-March 2022.



### GPS Devices

I have created a separate page for all of my articles and information relating to individual [GPS devices](devices/README.md).

Use the link above to access the articles!



### General Guidance

Some general articles relating to GPS technology are listed below:

- [General Guidance](guidance.md) has been written for all users of smart / sports watches - 4 Apr 2022
- [GPS Devices - Speed Sailing Feature Comparison](devices/feature-comparison.pdf) was my original GPS guide - 6 Jul 2010

Further detailed / technical articles are also available in the GitHub pages of [GPS Wizard](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-wizard/articles.html).
