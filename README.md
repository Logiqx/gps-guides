## GPS Guides

### Background

Back in 2010, I published an extensive GPS [feature comparison](devices/feature-comparison.pdf) with a primary focus on speed sailing.

The Locosys [GT-31](devices/locosys/gt-31/README.md) was the "gold-standard" device at the time but technology has since moved on and aside from writing up my first impressions of the Locosys [GW-52](devices/locosys/gw-52/README.md), I haven't written any subsequent GPS articles.

After several years using the Locosys [GW-60](devices/locosys/gw-60/README.md) watch (successor to the GW-52), I've now upgraded to the COROS [APEX Pro](devices/coros/apex-pro/README.md) and [Motion Mini](devices/motion/mini/README.md). I've been using the APEX Pro regularly since June 2021 and had the Motion Mini since mid-March 2022.

Due to several [observations](devices/coros/data-issues.md) relating to the CORO APEX Pro, I've decided to write some new articles to share my findings and what I have learnt about other modern GPS devices.



### Articles

#### GPS Devices

I have created a separate page for all of my articles and information relating to individual [GPS devices](devices/README.md).



#### General Topics

- [Locosys Detective Work](detective.md) aimed to discover the most likely GPS chip of the GW-52 and GW-60 - 29 Apr 2022

- [Doppler Speed Resolution](devices/coros/apex-pro/speed-resolution.md) applies to the COROS APEX Pro + VERTIX and maybe other devices using the Sony chip - 2 Apr 2022
- [GPS Devices - Speed Sailing Feature Comparison](devices/feature-comparison.pdf) was my original GPS guide - 6 Jul 2010



#### Session Analysis

The session data and detailed analysis relating to all of my recent articles is also available on a [dedicated page](sessions/README.md).

GPS technology is pretty complex but it is certainly interesting to understand the general principles.

For those wanting some technical details, I'd recommend this [interactive](https://ciechanow.ski/gps) page, [GPS MOOC](https://scpnt.stanford.edu/about/gps-mooc-massive-open-online-course) and the lectures on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1Fyn_h6LKU&list=PLGvhNIiu1ubyEOJga50LJMzVXtbUq6CPo).
