## GPS Guides

### Background

Back in 2010, I published a GPS [feature comparison](devices/feature-comparison.pdf) which focused on speed sailing.

Things have moved on in recent years, so this repository contains some more up-to-date information.



### General Guidance

Articles relating to the use of GPS technology:

- [General Guidance](guidance/README.md) has been written for all users of smart / sports watches - 4 Apr 2022
- [GPS Devices - Speed Sailing Feature Comparison](guidance/features/feature-comparison.pdf) was my original GPS guide - 6 Jul 2010

Further detailed / technical articles are also available in [GPS Details](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-details/) and [GPS Wizard](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-wizard/articles.html).



### Popular Devices

There is a separate page detailing several popular [GPS devices](devices/README.md).
