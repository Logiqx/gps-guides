## GPS Guides

### Background

Back in 2010, I published an extensive GPS [feature comparison](devices/feature-comparison.pdf) with a primary focus on speed sailing.

The Locosys [GT-31](devices/locosys/gt-31/README.md) was the "gold-standard" device at the time but technology has since moved on and aside from writing up my first impressions of the Locosys [GW-52](devices/locosys/gw-52/README.md), I haven't written any subsequent GPS articles.

After several years using the Locosys [GW-60](devices/locosys/gw-60/README.md) watch (successor to the GW-52), I've now upgraded to the COROS [APEX Pro](devices/coros/apex-pro/README.md) and [Motion Mini](devices/motion/mini/README.md). I've been using the APEX Pro regularly since June 2021 and had the Motion Mini since mid-March 2022.

Due to several observations relating to the CORO Apex Pro, I've decided to write some new articles to share my findings and what I have learnt about other modern GPS devices.



#### Spoiler Alert

I've discovered some surprising + frankly disappointing [issues](devices/coros/data-issues.md) with the data of the COROS APEX Pro. It's a great sports watch and I love it in many respects, except its GPS data quality. At best the data can be described as "ok" but it falls short of the GT-31.

The Motion Mini offers superior data quality and will now be my primary logging device. However, I'll also continue wearing the APEX Pro during windsurfing, windfoiling and wingfoiling sessions due to its instant feedback and various other handy features.



### Articles

#### GPS Devices

I have created a separate page for all of my articles and information relating to individual [GPS devices](devices/README.md).



#### General Topics

- [Doppler Speed Resolution](devices/coros/apex-pro/speed-resolution.md) applies to the COROS Apex Pro and maybe other devices using the Sony chip - 2 Apr 2022
- [GPS Devices - Speed Sailing Feature Comparison](devices/feature-comparison.pdf) was my original GPS guide - 6 Jul 2010



#### Analysis / Sessions

The session data and detailed analysis relating to all of my recent articles is also available on a [dedicated page](sessions/README.md).

GPS technology is pretty complex but it is certainly interesting to understand the general principles.

For those wanting some technical details, I'd recommend this [interactive](https://ciechanow.ski/gps) page, [GPS MOOC](https://scpnt.stanford.edu/about/gps-mooc-massive-open-online-course) and the lectures on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1Fyn_h6LKU&list=PLGvhNIiu1ubyEOJga50LJMzVXtbUq6CPo).
